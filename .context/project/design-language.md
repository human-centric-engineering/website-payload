# Design Language reference for the HCE Studio website

We are a modern tech-focused company, so we want a slick, modern user experience. The default theme should be dark, with a light theme available for those who choose.

Aside from photos of the team/network the imagery should be either abstract or illustration.

The use of icons to make things pop and standout is okay, but should not be overdone.

Some subtle animation is good.

Overall, we want to strike a balance between the modern-tech company who has a new approach, with our human-centric foundational beliefs. I.e. modern and slick, but not cold.

We quite like the look and feel of the Payload website itself https://payloadcms.com/, although we have our own colours of course.

## Colours

These are the key colours that we use.

- Black
- White
- Orange: rgb(235, 86, 0)
- Dark grey: rgb(40, 40, 40)
- Light grey: rgb(218, 217, 217)

We can also have shades and tones of these.
